**Discord Youtube Notifier** bot allows you to receive your Youtube notifications directly on Discord!

## Features

üö© Use of the simple RSS technology  
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Unlimited YouTubers support (you can add as many as you want)  
üåê Automatic resolving Youtube channels URLs  
üìù Custom messages for announcements messages  

## How it works?

Here is a simplified explanation of how the bot works:

*   Every 20 seconds, a function queries Youtube (using RSS) to get the latest video from the Youtuber.

*   If a video is found, it is checked twice:
    -   Was the video published after the bot started?  
    -   Hasn't the video already been posted on Discord?  

*   Then, the video is sent on discord

## Edit config

You must edit the configuration file for the bot to work correctly:

```Json
{
    "token": "your-discord-bot-token-here",
    "message": "New video **{videoTitle}** by **{videoAuthorName}** uploaded at **{videoPubDate}**! Link: {videoURL}",
    "channel": "your-channel-id-for-announcements-here",
    "youtubers": [
        "Pewdiepie",
        "Squeezie",
        "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNuYih-JMtLxOlsjeIos4ZA"
    ],
    "youtubeKey": "your http://console.developer.google.com youtube v3 api key"
}
```

**token**: your discord bot token  
**message**: the message that will be sent in the announcement channel when a new video is uploaded  
**channel**: the id of the announcement channel  
**youtubers**: an array of your subscriptions, this can be a youtuber name or a youtuber channel url  
**youtubeKey**: your youtube api v3 api key. It can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)
